# NIHPO's Synthetic Health Data Platform

Lifesciences companies need access to unencumbered health data to accelerate their development, testing, and validation processes. Realistic, scientifically-valid yet synthetic health data can help shrink the regulatory approval timeline.

NIHPOâ€™s Synthetic Health Data Platform helps *all staff roles* at *life sciences companies* to *reduce the time* it takes to 
* design, 
* develop, 
* test, 
* validate, and
* obtain regulatory approval for
new *drugs* and *medical devices*.

The Platform programmatically generates realistic, 100% scientifically correct, yet fully synthetic people ("SynthPerson").
For each SynthPerson the platform generates a complete synthetic Personal Health Record ("SynthPHR").
SynthPatients live in a series of geographically-accurate synthetic cities ("SynthCity"). 
SynthPatients are then randomly selected to participate in synthetic Clinical Trials ("SynthTrials"). 
Platform users define the parameters of a clinical trial and the platform generates all SDTM domains for the desired number of subjects.
Once the Synthetic Trial is generated, users can build the equivalent of a full digital Synthetic Submission ("SynthSubmission") to a Health Agency.
