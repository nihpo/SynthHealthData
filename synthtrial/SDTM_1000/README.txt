= = Purpose = =

Lifesciences companies need access to unencumbered health data to accelerate their development, testing, and validation processes. Realistic, scientifically-valid yet synthetic health data can help shrink the regulatory approval timeline.

NIHPO’s Synthetic Health Data Platform helps all staff roles at life sciences companies to reduce the time* it takes to 
* design, 
* develop, 
* test, 
* validate, and
* obtain regulatory approval for
new drugs and medical devices.

The platform programmatically generates realistic synthetic patients (“SynthPatients”) that have a complete synthetic Personal Health Record (“SynthPHR”). SynthPatients live in a series of geographically-accurate synthetic cities (“SynthCity”). SynthPatients are then randomly selected to participate in synthetic Clinical Trials (“SynthTrials”).
Platform users can define the parameters of a clinical trial and the platform generates all SDTM domains for the desired number of subjects.

Once the Synthetic Trial is finished, you can generate a Synthetic Submission to a Health Agency.

NIHPO's Synthetic Health Data Platform:
[SynthPHR] => [SynthTrial] => [SynthSubmission]

In this repository you can analyze and download the Python-based software that powers this platform.



= = Usage Notes = =

This compressed file includes the CDISC SDTM files generated by a synthetic clinical trial.

Included files:
* CSV files of all CDISC SDTM domains
* SAS files of all CDISC SDTM domains
* SQLite3 database file with the full synthetic Personal Health Record for all synthetic Subjects, plus all CDISC SDTM domains.

Please see https://github.com/nihpo/SynthHealthData/tree/main/synthphr for a full description of the synthetic PHR data files.

Please see https://github.com/nihpo/SynthHealthData/tree/main/synthtrial for a description of the synthetic trial data files.


These synthetic clinical trial data files:
* are 100% scientifically valid (LOINC, SNOMED-CT)
* include Real World Data (devices; drugs; US providers)

Synthetic data significantly reduces time to:
* Test, validate trial software
* Predict, solve trial data issues early
* Compile trial data into full submission
* "Walk" SynthPatients through SynthTrials
* Perform end-to-end test, QA, validation


The Problem we Solve
Access to realistic, unencumbered health data:
* Before real clinical trial data becomes available
* Assist during clinical
* Software Development
* Software Testing: Fuzz Testing, corner cases
* Shorten Quality Assurance cycles
* Crucial for end-to-end System Validation
