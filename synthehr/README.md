# Synthetic Electronic Hhealth Record ("SynthEHR")

What would be the business impact if you could simulate the entire Central Platform architecture *before* you actually built it in 03/05 years? How much time and money would that save the organization?

Here's a suggestion: having customized synthetic data early on can even help you and your team to better define the *requirements* for the Central Platform.

NIHPO can build an end-to-end "underground universe" of synthetic data for you.
Where the underground world matches the "real" data flowing across all units of a hoospital system. 


Hospital system would be able to simulate the patient journey inside a single (synthetic) hospital. For thousands of synthetic patients.

And then exchange synthetic patient records across multiple synthetic hospitals.

All from your desktop computer. And obviously our synthetic data avoids security, privacy, and copyright issues.
