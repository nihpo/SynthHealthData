Synth Health Data - Site Structure


[Wed 04 August 2021]

We want to provide an "Alternative Reality" to help you conduct all 
Use different types (and formats) of Synthetic Data (below) to test every area of the drug and medical device development process.

You can use our synthetic data as a placeholder until you receive the real data.
And you can run as many simulations as you want, from the comfort and privacy of your desktop.


Data earlier => test faster.
Know earlier => decide faster.
Validate earlier => submit faster.
