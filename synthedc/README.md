# Synthetic Electronic Data Capture ("SynthEDC")

We're exploring the business value of building synthetic, unencumbered Electronic Data Capture ("EDC") datasets at scale.

The initial phases of this project are:
a.) Identify the file format used by the 05 most popular EDC software packages.
b.) Generate synthetic EDC files for those 05 packages.
c.) Integrate the SynthEDC output files with our current [SynthSubmission](/synthsubmission) work.
