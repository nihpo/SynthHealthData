# Synthetic Electronic Data Capture ("SynthEDC")

We're exploring the business value of building synthetic, unencumbered Electronic Data Capture ("EDC") datasets at scale.

The initial phases of this project are:
* Identify the file format used by the 05 most popular EDC software packages.
* Generate synthetic EDC files for those 05 packages.
* Integrate the SynthEDC output files with our current [SynthSubmission](/synthsubmission) work.
