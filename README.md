# NIHPO's Synthetic Health Data Platform
NIHPOâ€™s Synthetic Health Data Platform helps *all staff roles* at *life sciences companies* to *reduce the time* it takes to 
* design, 
* develop, 
* test, 
* validate, and
* obtain regulatory approval for
new *drugs* and *medical devices*.

We empower Business Users to become Citizen Developers.



a.) User generates Synthetic Personal Health Records ("SynthPHRs") on demand, at scale.
User can create synthetic cohorts at will: assign gender distribution; define age ranges; select countries; include / exclude pre-existing disease types; etc.
The generated SynthPHR files are saved in the user's account. And available for download.
Please see the [SynthPHR](/synthphr) section for more details.


b.) User runs the pre-generated synthetic cohorts through a Synthetic Clinical Trial.
Select a pre-defined "Synthetic PHR" created above, define a clinical trial (arms, phases, visits, etc.), and "run" the cohort through the trial.
User will be able to re-run the same cohort through as many trials as needed.
The system will generate the full output for a trial (CDISC-formatted files, in both CSV and SAS format).
The generated SynthTrial files are saved in the user's account. And available for download.
Please see the [SynthTrial](/synthtrial) section for more details.


c.) User selects a pre-defined SynthTrial and we'll build a Docker image with a full "Computable Clinical Trial Submission".
The Docker image will include all the CDISC SDTM files, plus the SynthPHRs, plus other files we're working on.
Please see the [SynthTrial](/synthtrial) section for more details.


Users will be able to boot the Docker image in Azure, as a full self-contained regulatory submission.

The goal is to showcase how Azure is an ideal platform for long-term storage of "computable" regulatory submissions.


Imagine this: a user will be able to go from zero to a fully computable (synthetic) regulatory submission in under an hour.
Accessible through a web browser, hosted in Azure, with no IT intervention.
How many hours of drudgery and copy-and-paste work can we save to staffers in medical device and Pharma companies?
