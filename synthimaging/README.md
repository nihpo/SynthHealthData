# Synthetic Medical Imaging ("SynthImaging")

There seems to be a scarcity of scientifically-valid yet synthetic medical images.

We're exploring the business value of building synthetic, unencumbered Electronic Data Capture ("EDC") datasets at scale.

The initial phases of this project are:
* Identify the 05 most common disease targets for clinical trials that use imaging.
* Generate synthetic images (both DICOM as well as JPEG) for those disease targets.
* Integrate the SynthImaging output files with our current [SynthSubmission](/synthsubmission) work.

There are massive amounts of freely-available, unencumbered real imaging data:
* [University of South Florida's "Digital Database for Screening Mammography"](http://www.eng.usf.edu/cvprg/Mammography/Database.html)
* [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)


Our plan is to leverage that real imaging data to then programmatically generate synthetic imaging files.
