# Synthetic Medical Imaging ("SynthImaging")

There seems to be a scarcity of scientifically-valid yet synthetic medical images.

We're exploring the business value of building synthetic, unencumbered Electronic Data Capture ("EDC") datasets at scale.

The initial phases of this project are:
a.) Identify the 05 most common disease targets for clinical trials that use imaging.
b.) Generate synthetic images (both DICOM as well as JPEG) for those disease targets.
c.) Integrate the SynthImaging output files with our current [SynthSubmission](/synthsubmission) work.
